= None in Python
When type classes come to your rescue

Consider the following Python code snippet:

.Example: `script.py`
[source,python]
----
my_var = None
print("Value of the variable my_var is", my_var)

your_var = "None"
print("Value of the variable your_var is", your_var)
----

When you run the script, the following output is displayed:

[source,terminal]
----
Value of the variable my_var is None
Value of the variable your_var is None
----

Although `my_var` and `your_var` has different values, there is no way to distinguish them based on the output of the script.

When working with variables that may contain a `None` value, it is better to print their type classes instead of their values. For example:

.Example: `script.py` printing type classes
[source,python]
----
my_var = None
print("Type class of the variable my_var is", type(my_var))

your_var = "None"
print("Type class of the variable your_var is", type(your_var))
----

.Output with type classes
[source,terminal]
----
Type class of the variable my_var is <class 'NoneType'>
Type class of the variable your_var is <class 'str'>
----

Such an approach is a safer, and hence better, approach to working with variables in Python that may have the value `None`. In any case, using `print` statements for debugging is a terrible idea and a bad practice.
